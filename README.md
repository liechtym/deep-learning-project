This project attempts a relatively new idea we refer to as "scene extension". It uses neural networks to make a shorter image wider by generating a plausible extension to the scene.

The write up for this project and its results can be viewed [here](project_paper.pdf).

The `.ipynb` notebooks used to create these models are included in the root directory. The models were trained on Google Colab GPUs.
